# pillowmart


PillowMart is a personal project built to demonstrate my skills in Python and Django web development. The frontend template was adapted from a free design provided by freehtmlthemes.ru, and integrated into a functional e-commerce-style web application.

This project showcases backend integration, template rendering, URL routing, and basic CRUD operations using Django.
